"""scripts/board.py — the PyAutoMemory Dashboard.

A phone-readable, MANAGEMENT-FIRST view of the repo's knowledge: what is
waiting to be read, which paper sections still need a canonical BibTeX key,
how mature each sub-wiki is — each work queue carrying a one-tap 📋 copy
block holding a paste-ready AI assistant prompt that executes this repo's own
documented workflow (``bibliography/README.md`` "Adding a paper",
``wiki/AGENTS.md``'s schema) — plus contents cards with ``Use the memory skill. <domain>``
recall chips. Reading-queue sections expand to the individual papers: each
title links out to the arXiv abstract page (or, when the line carries no ref,
a title search — see ``scripts/arxiv_refs.py``), carries a 📄 button onto the
PDF itself so a phone can collect a stack of papers without a detour through
search, and carries three prefilled-GitHub-issue actions — 📥 intake-into-memory
(really interesting: full filing), 📑 make-citeable (worth citing, not
pivotal: bib entry + minimal sources section), both open work items carrying
the human's free-text notes, and ✅ read-don't-file (processed automatically
by ``queue_actions.yml`` via ``queue_mark_done.py``). Nothing changes state
until the human submits the issue.

Above the queue sits the **arXiv inbox** (``arxiv-inbox.md``): what the nightly
digest suggested overnight, each line showing how many days it has left before
it lapses and carrying the same 📄 PDF button plus two further actions —
➕ add-to-the-queue and ✖️ dismiss.
The inbox's format, window and transitions live in ``scripts/inbox_actions.py``;
this module reads them rather than re-deriving them.

Below the inbox sits the **arXiv interests list** (``arxiv-interests.md``):
the same overnight machinery pointed at everything that is *not* strong
lensing — black holes, dark matter, galaxy formation, statistics — as one
day-batch of ten. It renders the same five actions per paper, plus one 🧹
*clear* button on the batch itself: the board shows the OLDEST un-cleared day
only and clearing it reveals the next. That batch carries a days-left count of
its own, because it lapses on the inbox's window if nobody clears it — whole,
a day at a time. ``scripts/interests_actions.py`` owns that format and those
transitions.

Both suggestion tiers also carry a **freshness line**: the date of the last digest run,
so an empty inbox says *which* kind of empty it is — arXiv was quiet, or the
filing broke. The date is rendered into the page, but the "this looks broken"
warning is computed in the reader's browser (see ``_EXTRA_JS``), because the
page freezes at its last good render in exactly the failure the warning is for.

A queue section is not a flat list of papers: a `__Bold__` line is a
sub-heading the human wrote, and a `NOTE `-prefixed line (or a bare non-arXiv
link) is an annotation. Both render as themselves — no link, no buttons, no
slot in the "N waiting" count — because a heading is not a paper you can
download. `_parse_paper` decides which is which; see `reading-queue.md`.

**Contents-level only.** The board shows titles and counts, never claim text
or summaries — the knowledge itself stays in the wiki pages.

**Fully local.** Everything renders from the checkout (no network):
frontmatter statuses, ``**Canonical BibTeX key:**`` markers, bib entry
counts, reading-queue sections, wikilink totals. Repo identity (for links)
derives from ``git remote`` — nothing is hardcoded, so the script travels
into spawned templates unchanged.

Published by ``.github/workflows/knowledge_board.yml`` (Pages + badge.json +
state.json, the organ-cockpit feed, + the README ``memory:begin/end`` strip).
Nothing is committed — ``validate_structure.py`` bans ``.html`` and gates the root allowlist, so the
board is rendered fresh in CI, the Heart pattern.
